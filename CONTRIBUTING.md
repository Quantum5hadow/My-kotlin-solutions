# contributing

hey,thanks for checking this out. here's how you can contribute 👇

## found a bug in a solution?

open an issue with:
- the problem number + name
- what's wrong (wrong output,edge case missed,etc)
- your fix if you have one

## want to suggest a better approach?

open a PR with:
- the problem number in the title
- explain why your approach is better (time/space complexity,readability,etc)
- keep the same file naming format: `YYYY-MM-DD_D##_ProblemID_ProblemName.kt`

## want to add a new solution?

this repo is my personal daily grind,so i probably won't merge solutions for days i haven't done yet. but feel free to fork it and build your own streak!

## style guide

- kotlin only
- keep solutions clean and readable
- no unnecessary imports
- follow the existing header format:

```kotlin
/*
LeetCode ID  : YourUsername
Profile      : https://leetcode.com/u/YourUsername/
Submission   : <link>
Problem      : <number>. <name>
Day          : <day>
Date         : YYYY-MM-DD
*/
```

## be cool

- no spam
- no ai-generated solutions without understanding them
- be respectful

thanks for stopping by 🙌
