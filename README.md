## 🧠 about

hey,i'm [**Quantum5hadow**](https://github.com/Quantum5hadow). i don't do "i'll start tomorrow." i just start.

this repo is my daily leetcode journal — one problem,every single day,all in kotlin. i pick a topic,go deep on it for a week (divisibility,balanced arrays,stock trading,geometry — whatever catches my eye),and always pair the easy version with the hard one back to back. no cherry-picking easy problems to feel good. if there's a part II,i'm solving it the next day.

140+ days in and the streak is still alive. not because i'm motivated every morning — i'm not. but discipline hits different when you stop negotiating with yourself.

> *"most people overestimate what they can do in a day and underestimate what they can do in 140 days"*

## 📁 file naming

every file follows this format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_D{day}_{problemID}_{ProblemName}.kt
```

for example:
```
2026-02-17_D140_401_Binary Watch.kt
│          │    │    └── problem name
│          │    └── leetcode problem id
│          └── day number of the streak
└── date solved
```

## 👀 sample solution

here's what a typical solution looks like — **day 140,binary watch**:

```kotlin
/*
LeetCode ID  : PixelPrince
Profile      : https://leetcode.com/u/PixelPrince/
Submission   : https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/solutions/...
Problem      : 401. Binary Watch
Day          : 140
Date         : 2026-02-17
*/

class Solution {
    fun readBinaryWatch(k: Int) =
        (0 until 720).mapNotNull {
            val h = it / 60
            val m = it % 60
            if (Integer.bitCount(h) + Integer.bitCount(m) == k)
                "%d:%02d".format(h, m)
            else null
        }
}
```

clean,readable,no fluff. every solution has a header with links back to the leetcode submission.
